# XFrames - cross-platform DOM-free GUI development for the desktop and the browser

**XFrames** is a high-performance library that empowers developers to build native desktop applications using whichever programming language they are familiar with, without the overhead of the DOM. XFrames was originally conceived as a streamlined alternative to Electron, designed for developers looking to maximize performance and efficiency. 

## Key Features

- **DOM-free rendering**: Bypasses the traditional DOM, providing a faster, more lightweight environment for GUI development.
- **Cross-platform support**: Easily create applications for multiple platforms, including the browser through WebAssembly, while maintaining a native feel.
- **Advanced layout capabilities**: Leverage the power and flexibility of [Yoga layouts](https://www.yogalayout.dev/).

## Getting started

### Node.js

At the moment the easiest way to get started on Node.js is to run

```
npx create-xframes-node-app
```

Enter a name for your project then wait until source files and dependencies are installed, then

```
cd <project-name>
npm start
```

You should see the following:

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a key priority for the future of **XFrames**. While the current version lacks comprehensive accessibility support, we are committed to making XFrames an inclusive framework that provides equitable access for all users. Upcoming development will focus on implementing accessibility features and adhering to industry standards, ensuring XFrames applications can be used effectively by people with disabilities. Our goal is to create a robust, accessible platform that enables developers to build applications for diverse audiences with confidence.

## Basic online WASM demo

([online demo](https://andreamancuso.github.io/react-wasm/dear-imgui)) Only browsers that natively support WebGPU: Chrome, Edge, Firefox nightly, possibly Safari (though I have not tested it).

#### General considerations for Ubuntu

This may seem obvious, particularly if you are an experienced Linux user/developer, so this is for the avoidance of the doubt: building xframes on Ubuntu 24.04 means that the generated binary extension will run on Ubuntu 24.04 but not on Ubuntu 22.04 (or older). As part of doing our tests, the binary extension generated using Ubuntu 22.04 did work fine on Ubuntu 24.04. Moving forward, we'll try to build it on even earlier versions of Ubuntu, i.e. 20.04
