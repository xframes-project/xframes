# XFrames - DOM-free GUI development

## Motivation

I've always found DOM-free GUI development very interesting conceptually but I never really needed to use it - until relatively recently.

I invested quite a bit of time and effort into figuring out how [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) and [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/index.html) work. I eventually managed to compile the [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) emscripten example and modified it to suit my requirements. Given my lack of experience with C/C++, I can tell you that this has been far from being a straightforward process. I have eventually realized that someone else out there might benefit from this experience of mine.

As I write these paragraphs, I realise that, despite accomplishing a few small initial goals, there is still lot to do. I hope you find these libraries useful, if anything just to get yourself acquainted with WebAssembly, C/C++, GLFW, OpenGL.

## Caveats

### Overall quality

I work on this project during my spare time so the overall quality is ... suboptimal. Please bear with me while I make the necessary improvements.

Due of my limited expertise with C/C++, you might come across bugs - and the code may not be particularly performant.

On the plus side, although still lacking, I added some unit tests for the C++ layer.

### Performance

As the rendering is delegated to the GPU, the overall performance should be at the very least half-decent. That said, I am still getting familiar with the more advanced data structures available in C++. 

I still need to benchmark/compare the differences in terms performance between WASM and the native Node module.

### Accessibility

GUI libraries such as [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) are a very good example of accessible non-DOM based GUIs. The overall impression I get is that DOM-based GUIs are more accessible. Perhaps this project will foster interest in the topic and motivate people and/or companies to invest more in this area.

### Support for other frameworks

At the moment I am focusing on bindings for React only. The renderer is actually adapted from react-native's Fabric renderer.
Perhaps there are other options I could/should have considered. Feel free to let me know your thoughts.

## Basic online demo

([online demo](https://andreamancuso.github.io/react-wasm/dear-imgui)) Only browsers that natively support WebGPU: Chrome, Edge, Firefox nightly, possibly Safari (though I have not tested it).
